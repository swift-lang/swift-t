== Overview

This manual provides an index of important concepts internal to
Turbine.

== Quick start

The fastest way to get a quick overview of provided features is to just run:

--------------------------------------------------------
./setup.sh
./configure --with-adlb=<PATH/TO/ADLB>
            --with-mpi=<PATH/TO/MPICH>
            --with-tcl=<PATH/TO/TCL>
make package

Note:

PATH/TO/ADLB  : Points to source tree
PATH/TO/MPICH : Points to installed location
PATH/TO/TCL   : Points to installed location
--------------------------------------------------------

Then, just take a look at the test code and output to see how things
work.

== Tcl packaging

Turbine consists of two libraries, ADLB and Turbine, packaged as Tcl
extensions, and several Tcl script libraries.  All of this is packaged
with Tcl conventions in +lib+.  Cf. +lib/make-package.tcl+ and
+lib/module.mk.in+.

To bring these extensions and libraries into a Tcl script, we use:

--------------------------------------------------------
package require turbine 0.1
--------------------------------------------------------

This command refers to environment variable +TCLLIBPATH+, which we
set in +bin/turbine+.

== MPI process modes

A Turbine program is a TCL script launched as an SPMD program by
+mpiexec+.  In general, the idea is to do

--------------------------------------------------------
mpiexec -l -n ${N} tclsh something.tcl
--------------------------------------------------------

In our case, we provide a helper script.  So in the test cases, we run

--------------------------------------------------------
bin/turbine -l -n ${N} test/something.tcl
--------------------------------------------------------

The Turbine MPI environment is set by the +mpiexec -n+ number and the
inputs to +turbine::init+.  As a result, each MPI process will become
a Turbine Worker or ADLB Server.

Turbine Worker::

Runs on the lowest MPI ranks.  Rank 0 calls the user +rules+
procedure, starting the program.  Work from this procedure may be
distributed to other workers.

ADLB Server::

Performs ADLB services, including task queues, data storage, and
data-dependent task release.  Enters +ADLB_Server()+ and does not exit
until the run is complete.
Cf. +src/tcl/adlb/tcl-adlb.c::ADLB_Server_Cmd()+.  Runs on the highest
MPI ranks.

In Tcl, the mode is stored in +turbine::mode+ and is either
+WORKER+ or +SERVER+.

== Software structure

The Turbine API is a Tcl API.  Some of the features are defined in
Tcl, some are hand-coded Tcl extensions, and some are SWIG-generated
Tcl extensions.

* All Tcl source is in +lib+
* Turbine C code, e.g. for caches and the worker loop is in +src/turbine+
* Tcl extensions are in +src/tcl+
** +src/tcl/turbine+ wraps up Turbine C code for Tcl
** +src/tcl/adlb+ is the Tcl extension for the ADLB code in the ADLB
   package. This includes the ADLB data calls
** +src/tcl/blob+ is a SWIG-generated module for advanced blob
   functionality
** +src/tcl/mpe+ is the MPE library for Turbine

== Turbine concepts

TD::

A Turbine datum.  Represented in Tcl by a 64-bit TD number.  A TD may be
open (unset) or closed (set).  TD IDs are represented in the log as
+<ID>+.  The types are:

* void
* integer
* float
* string
* blob
* container

Rules::

The ADLB/Turbine data dependency engine makes progress by evaluating
Turbine rules.
* A rule has a a input TD list, a TD/subscript list, a rule type,
  and an action, and optional arguments.
* The action is a simple Tcl string that is +eval+'d by a possibly
  different Tcl process.  This allows actions to be load balanced by
  ADLB.
* Rule types are:
** +CONTROL+: put the action into ADLB for evaluation elsewhere
** +WORK+: put the action into ADLB for evaluation by a worker
** +LOCAL+: send the task to local worker (deprecated) 
* When rules are evaluated, they produce in-memory records called
  transforms.
* When the transform is ready, it is released to the appropriate
  ADLB task queue to be retrieved by a worker.
* The function body targeted by the action can contain arbitrary Tcl code,
  lookup data from the given TDs, launch external processes via Tcl
  +exec+, and store TDs, and issue more rule statements.

TR IDs are represented in the log as +{ID}+.

Container::

Element from which Turbine data structures are created.  May be used
to create associative arrays, structs, and other data structures.
Represented by a TD.  A TD plus a subscript results in another TD.
+
Container operations are represented in the log as, e.g.,
+<4>["k"]=<8>+, indicating that container TD 4 with subscript "k"
resulted in TD 8.

Subscribe::

TRs are stored in the ADLB servers.  To make progress,
the TRs are activated when their input data is ready.  Thus, the
servers subscribe to data stored in ADLB and are notified when
data is ready.

== Symbols

This describes the symbols available to the Turbine programmer.  These
features are required when writing STC or constructing Swift/T
extensions.

=== Turbine core

The core Turbine features are as follows.

==== Program structure

Turbine code is Tcl code.  For example:

----
> cat hello.tcl
puts HELLO
> turbine -n 3 hello.tcl
HELLO
HELLO
HELLO
----

The following code is found in nearly every Turbine program:

----
package require turbine 0.1
turbine::defaults
turbine::init $servers
turbine::start rules
turbine::finalize
----

It loads the Turbine Tcl package, loads defaults and environment
settings, initializes Turbine, starts progress, and finalizes.

The rules proc contains the initial calls to get the program
running. It is only executed by the worker with rank 0.

Other code may be placed in functions.

==== Startup/shutdown

+defaults+::
Sets variable servers in the caller's scope
+ADLB_SERVERS+ is stored in servers, defaults to 1

+init servers+::
Initialize Turbine
Initializes ADLB

+finalize+::
Shuts down and reports unused rules

=== ADLB layer

Turbine uses ADLB to distribute tasks and locate data.

All Turbine variables are stored in a customized data store built into
ADLB.  This required the construction of additional ADLB API calls.

The following ADLB features are available to Turbine.  Usually, they
are used internally by the Turbine features, they are not called
directly by the user script.

*tcl-adlb.c*

+adlb::SUCCESS+::

Variable represents +ADLB_SUCCESS+.

+adlb::ANY+::

Variable represents "any", which is -1 in ADLB.

+adlb::init servers types+::

Start ADLB with the given number of servers and work types.

+adlb::finalize+::

Stop ADLB.

+adlb::put reserve_rank work type work_unit+::

Submit a work unit as a string of given integer type.  Sent to given
rank, which may be +adlb::ANY+.

+adlb::get req_type answer_rank+::

Get a work unit as a string of given integer type, which may be
+adlb::ANY+.  ADLB answer rank stored in +answer_rank+.

+adlb::create id data+::

Instantiate the given data but do not close it.  Data may be:

* +string:+
* +integer:+
* +container:<type>+
  where +type+ is the type of the container keys.
* +file:<name>+
  where +name+ is the file name.

+adlb::store id data+::

Store the TD.

+adlb::retrieve id+::

Retrieve the TD.

+adlb::insert id subscript member+::

Store TD +member+ at the given +subscript+ in container +id+.

+adlb::lookup id subscript+::

Obtain the TD for the given +subscript+ in container +id+.

+adlb::unique+::

Return a unique TD.

==== Internals

*adlb.c*

+ADLB_Subscribe(id)+::

Called only by Turbine rule processing.  Request that the calling rank
be notified when TD +id+ is closed.

=== Data

==== Data allocation

Data must be allocated before it may be used as the input to a rule.

*data.tcl*

+allocate [<name>] <type> -> td+::

Creates and returns a unique TD.  The TD is actually stored on some
ADLB server, the user does not know which one. If +name+ is given,
logs a message based on +name+.

+allocate_container [<name>] <subscript type> -> td+::

Creates and returns a unique TD that is a container with the given
subscript type: +"integer"+ or +"string"+

==== Data storage/retrieval

Data storage/retrieval allows you to store Tcl values in Turbine and
retrieve Turbine TDs as Tcl values.

*data.tcl*

* +store_integer td value+
* +retrieve_integer td -> value+
* +store_string td value+
* +retrieve_string td -> value+
* +store_float td+
* +retrieve_float td -> value+
* +store_void td+
* +store_blob td [ list pointer length]+
* +retrieve_blob td -> [ list pointer length ]+

Once you have the values in Tcl, you can perform arbitrary operations
and store results back into Turbine.

You can think of Turbine as a load/store architecture, where the
Turbine data store is main memory and the local Tcl operations
and values are the CPU and its registers.

+void+ type variables may be used to represent pure dataflow- e.g.,
Swift external variables. Internally, these are just an integer.

+blob+ values in Turbine/Tcl are a +[ list pointer length ]+, where
the pointer is stored as a Tcl integer and the length is the byte
length.

* Note that to pass these pointers to SWIG interfaces you have
to cast them to +void*+, +double*+, etc.  Tools are provided by the
Turbine +blobutils+ package to do this.
* The pointer points to a locally allocated copy of the blob data.
This must be freed with +adlb::blob_free+.  Auto-wrapped STC functions
will automatically insert this instruction.


==== Literals

There is a convenience function to set up literal data.

*functions.tcl*

----
set x [ literal integer 3 ]
   or
literal x integer 3
----

Now x is a closed TD of type integer with value 3.

=== Progress (rules)

Data-dependent progress is controlled by Turbine rules.

A Turbine rule statement contains:

----
rule input_list action options...
----

+input_list+:: A space-separated list (Tcl list) of TDs.  When these
are are closed, the action is +eval+'d.
+action+:: A string of Tcl code for execution once all inputs are
closed. Essentially, when all the inputs are closed, Turbine will make
the action ready for execution, based on the +type+.

==== Options

All options are optional

----
rule input_list action name "myfunction" type $turbine::WORK location 4 parallelism 2
----

+name+:: An arbitrary string name used for debugging and logging.
Turbine will make up a default name
+type+:: +LOCAL+, +CONTROL+, or +WORK+.  Default is +CONTROL+
+parallelism+:: Number of processes to use for an MPI parallel task.  Default is 1.
+target+:: Send action to this MPI rank.  Default is any available process based on +type+ (+$adlb::RANK_ANY+)

==== Semantics

The rule statement semantics are as follows, with respect to the Tcl
thread of execution.

* I can pause here
* I have an action I would like to perform at some point in the future
* I can restart myself given the action string
* Do not restart me until the given inputs are closed
* When my action completes, my outputs will be closed
* For +CONTROL+ or +WORK+, you can execute my action on a different node
(I will be able to find my data (and call stack) in the global store)

==== Naming

The name "rule" was chosen because this is somewhat like a Makefile
rule, and the analogy was intended to be helpful.

==== Rationale

A Turbine rule is not just a control structure, it is data- it has an
identifier and debug token, is stored in data structures, is loggable,
debuggable, etc.  The arbitrary action string provides a lot of
flexibility in how the statement may be used (by the code generator)

=== Functions

A good way to manage progress is to define Tcl functions (procs) for
use in the execution string.

To implement a Swift function, we often have three Tcl
functions. Consider Swift function +f()+:

* The "rule" function: conventionally called +f+. This is called to
register the function call with the ADLB/Turbine dataflow engine
* The rule statement stores the action until the inputs are ready
* The "body" function: conventionally called +f_body+. This is
  called when the inputs are ready. The body function retrieves data,
  computes, and stores data
* The "impl" function: conventionally called +f_impl+.  The impl acts
  on values, not addresses. This is convenient because sometimes STC
  can optimize addresses and operate on values. This saves on calls
  to the ADLB data API, which uses messaging and is expensive. Thus,
  you do not need an impl function if you just want to perform the
  computation in the body function

----
# x, y and z are string TDs. x and y may be unset
proc f { stack z x y } {
  rule f-$x-$y [ list $x $y ] $turbine::LOCAL "f_body no_stack $x $y $z"
}

# x, y and z are string TDs.  x and y are now set
proc f_body { stack x y z } {
  set s1 [ retrieve_string $x ]
  set s2 [ retrieve_string $y ]
  set s3 [ f_impl $s1 $s2 ]
  store_string $z $s3 
}

# x and y are string values
proc f_impl { x y } {
  return compute_something $x $y
}

# Calling code:

allocate x string
allocate y string
allocate z string

store_string $x "sample1"
store_string $y "sample2"

f no_stack $z $x $y
----

The previous example could have used the literal function but it is an
opportunity to show things in full detail.

Implementation reference: the Turbine tests and any STC-generated code.

=== Operations

These are the operations available in Turbine.

==== Arithmetic

All arithmetic functions operate on TDs and are of the form:
----
op stack outputs inputs
----
The impl versions operate on values and are of the form:
----
op_impl inputs -> outputs
----

|===================================

==== Statistics

Statistics functions are in *stats.tcl*.  These make straightforward
use of the Turbine API and Tcl arithmetic capabilities.

==== String manipulation

String functions are in *string.tcl*.  These make straightforward use
of the Turbine API and Tcl string capabilities.

=== Containers

A container is a TD that is allows one to insert and retrieve TDs
contained by it.  It is used to represent associative arrays, structs,
and stack frames.

Lookups are performed on "subscripts", which are serialized, hashable
representations of the keys.  Each container has a subscript type that
represents the type of the keys: this allows for Swift loop variables
to be automatically defined. The values stored are "members" which are
strings- they typically represent TDs.  Thus, arbitrary data may be
stored in a container as an optimization

Rules may wait on the whole container TD just like any other TD.  TDs
that are members of a container are not special. They are simply
linked into the container data structure.

*tcl-adlb.c*

+allocate_container td type+::
Initialize a TD as a container with the given subscript type, which
may be integer or string. The members in the container may be of any
type

+container_typeof td -> type+::
Get the subscript type of the container as a Tcl string.
Use +typeof+ to get the type of a member.

+adlb::enumerate td subscripts|members|dict|count count|all offset+::
* +subscripts+:: Return list of subscript strings
* +members+::    Return list of member TDs
* +dict+::       Return Tcl dict mapping subscripts to TDs
* +count+::      Return integer count of container elements
* +count,all,offset+:: Return all entries or just +count+, starting
from +offset+

+container_list td -> list+::
Obtain all subscripts in the container as a big Tcl list
(Convenience wrapper around enumerate)

+container_size td -> count+:: (Convenience wrapper around enumerate)

+container_reference c i r+::
Make +r+ a reference for +c[i]+. Thus, when +c[i]+ is inserted, +r+ is
closed by the system.  +r+ is a copy of +c[i]+,
thus, +r+ must be of the same type as +c[i]+.

*data.tcl*

+container_insert container_td subscript member+::
Link member TD into the container at given subscript member is
typically a TD, allowing for linked data.

+container_lookup container td subscript -> member+::
Lookup the member corresponding to the subscript in the given container

==== Advanced container operations

These are used to support the full set of possible Swift/T array
operations.

Currently, these contain these +existing name+, the *proposed name*,
and a proposed shorthand notation *(PSN)*.

*functions.tcl*

+range container start end+::
Fill and close given container with integer subscripts that map to
TDs that are integers from +start+ to +end+

==== Blobs

Blobs (Binary Large OBjects) may be used to represent byte data
(pointer+length).  This is to allow Turbine data store to store
native data from C/C++/Fortran.

When blobs are retrieved from ADLB, they are stored in a local cache.
These entries should be freed before returning control to Turbine.

In Tcl, the blob is a +[ list pointer length ]+ where +pointer+ and
+length+ are integers.  +pointer+ is the real pointer to the blob's
data- it may be passed into a C function as +void*+.  +length+ is the
size in bytes.

*blob.tcl*

+blob_from_string+::
Convert a Tcl string into a blob. String will be NULL-terminated.

+string_from_blob+::
Convert a blob into a string. String must be NULL-terminated

+blob_from_floats+::
Convert a container of floats into a blob, which is actually a C
array of doubles

+floats_from_blob+::
Convert a blob into a container of floats

+blob_size_async+::
Obtain the size of a blob in bytes

*tcl-adlb.c*

+retrieve_blob td → [ list pointer length ]+::
Retrieve a blob from ADLB and store in the local cache.
The user must free this from cache.  Returns the pointer and length in
a Tcl list.

+blob_free td+::
Free the blob from the local cache.

+store_blob td pointer length+::
Store blob in ADLB

*blob.c*

===== Usage

This illustrates what can go in a typical Swift/T leaf function

Assumes blobs id1, id2 have been created

----
# Retrieve input blob
set L1 [ adlb::retrieve_blob $id1 ]
set pointer1 [ lindex 0 $L1 ]
set length1 [ lindex 1 $L1 ]

# Call C function
set L2 [ user::compute $pointer1 $length1 ]

# C function returned pointer and length in L2
set pointer2 [ lindex 0 $L2 ]
set length2  [ lindex 1 $L2 ]

# Store C function result
turbine::store_blob $id2 [ list $pointer2 $length2 ]

# Free from local cache
adlb::blob_free $id1
----

=== I/O

Turbine I/O capabilities.

*functions.tcl*

+trace+::
Simply outputs the values of the given TDs without formatting.

*io.tcl*

+printf+::
As +printf()+ in C.  The format string is handled with the Tcl
+format+ command.

*files.tcl*

*TODO: files.tcl*

=== Void

Operations for +void+ variables

*functions.tcl*

+make_void+::
Create and close a +void+ TD

+zero+::
Convert a +void+ to the integer 0.

=== Updateables

*updateable.tcl*

TODO: updateables

=== Assertions

*assert.tcl*

Assertion functions are in *assert.tcl*.  These make straightforward
use of the Turbine API and Tcl capabilities.  When they fail, they
bring the whole Turbine execution down.

=== Logging

*tcl-turbine.c*

+log+::
Simply report the given string to stdout with a timestamp.  This may
be disabled by setting environment variable +TURBINE_LOG=0+.

=== MPE

MPE is the primary way to obtain profiling and debugging information
from Turbine/ADLB.  CPU profiling information can also be obtained
without recompilation as described in the CPU profiling section below.
MPE log entries are automatically created by ADLB if enabled at configure
time.  One additional MPE function is available from Turbine:

+metadata+::
Simply insert the given string into the log.

The MPE log will contain solo events with the "metadata" event type.

It is safe to call this function even if MPE is not configured - it
will simply be a noop.

=== System

System functions are in *sys.tcl*.  These make straightforward use of
the Turbine API and Tcl capabilities.  See the Swift/T documentation
for a sense of the purpose of these features.

=== Blob manipulation

TODO

== CPU Profiling
It is possible to obtain information about CPU usage in Turbine by using
the Google perftools CPU profiler.  This profiler is non-intrusive: it
doesn't require recompilation, only that the application is compiled with
debugging symbols (the default).  The profiler is a sampling profiler,
which means that it periodically snapshots the program's stack.  This is
good for finding out where your program spends its time, but will not
provide information on the number of times a function is called, or the
duration of an individual function call.  The tools are available at
http://code.google.com/p/gperftools/, and may be available as an operation
system package (e.g. gperftools in Ubuntu).  Once installed, you can
enable the profiler with the CPUPROFILE and LD_PRELOAD environment
variables.  E.g. if using Mpich, which automatically passes environment
variables to MPI processes, the following is sufficient:

    export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libprofiler.so
    export CPUPROFILE=./turbine.prof
    turbine -n8 program.tcl

This will output profiling information files with the ./turbine.prof prefix
and the process ID appended.  Once you have the profiles, you can view the
information in various formats, including text and graphical.

    pprof --text `which tclsh8.5` turbine.prof_12345 > turbine.prof_12345.txt
    pprof --pdf `which tclsh8.5` turbine.prof_12345 > turbine.prof_12345.pdf

Note: on Ubuntu, pprof is renamed to google-pprof.
