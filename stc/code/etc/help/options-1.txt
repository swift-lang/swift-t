    -A <argname>=<value>
         Bind command-line argument at compile-time, allowing
         creation of a compiled version of code specialized
         for given setting
    -C <output file>
         Write intermediate representation to this file
         (otherwise does not output it)
    -d <PORT>
       Use JDWP debugging on given PORT
    -D <MACRO>
       Define a CPP preprocessor macro
    -h
       Show all options
    -f <option name>
       toggle compiler option on
    -F <option name>
       toggle compiler option off
    -I <DIRECTORY>
       Add an include path
       TURBINE_HOME/export is always included to get standard library
    -j </path/to/java>
       Set JVM location.  Defaults to PATH entry for java
    -O <Optimization level>
       Set compiler optimization level:
         0 - no optimizations
         1,2,3 - standard optimizations (DEFAULT) (this will change later)
    -o <output file>
         Write output *.tic file here
    -p
       Disable preprocessing via CPP
    -r <DIRECTORY>
       Add an RPATH for a Swift/T extension
    -u
       Only compile if target is not up-to-date
    -U <FILE>
       Only compile if target is not up-to-date, including this FILE
       as an additional dependency.  This is typically used for
       imported or included *.swift source code, but can be anything.
       Implies -u .  Use -V to trace the up-to-date checks.
    -v
       Output version and configuration settings,
       including Java and Turbine locations,
       then exit
    -V
       Increase verbosity.  May be given twice for extreme verbosity.
