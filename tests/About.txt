= STC Test Suite

== Overview

Each test has to compile and run or else it fails

We compile each Swift script to the corresponding Tcl script, then run
Turbine on it.

Use +run-tests.zsh+ to run the tests.  This automates the following
simplified command lines:
----
stc 100-test.swift 100-test.tcl
turbine -n 2 100-test.tcl
----

This creates stc logs, intermediate code, and output files.

== Invocation

Available arguments:

+-c+:: Continue after failure
+-C+:: Compile only
+-D+:: Run disabled tests 
+-e+:: Show error outputs from tests
+-f <OPTION>+:: Use +stc -f OPTION+
+-F <OPTION>+:: Use +stc -F OPTION+
+-J:: Enable JaCoCo code coverage.
+-k <SKIP>+:: Skip the first SKIP tests
+-l+:: Enable Turbine data leak check
+-n <COUNT>+:: Run only COUNT tests
+-O <VALUE>+:: Use +stc -O VALUE+
+-p <PATTERN>+:: Run only tests with name containing string PATTERN
+-P <PATTERN>+:: Skip tests with name containing string PATTERN
+-V+ Verbose: turn on +set -x+ to debug +run-tests.zsh+ itself

Environment variables:

Environment variables are generally passed to subprocesses: stc, turbine, etc.
Some useful ones are:

+STC_LOG_TRACE+:: if set to true, produce trace-level log output from STC (default is debug-level

== Supporting files

Supporting files are optional. 

* Setup script: TEST.setup.sh: Is run before STC and Turbine.  Can
  create input files, etc.  Must return exit code 0 or test fails.
  This is sourced by the test script in a zsh subshell in such a way
  that any environment variables set will be available for STC and
  Turbine when running that test.
* Check script: TEST.check.sh: Is run after STC and Turbine.  Can
  check outputs, remove files, etc.  Must return exit code 0 or test
  fails.  E.g., can examine TEST.out for correctness.
* TEST.exp: Each line of this file must be in TEST.out or test fails.
* TEST.args: Arguments for run time, passed to user Swift program
* TEST.stcargs: Arguments for STC, used to modify STC behavior

== Tokens

Included in comments in TEST.swift to modify test behavior

NOTE: Tests that do not run should be linked to issues in exm-issues

* SKIP-THIS-TEST: Skips test entirely.
* COMPILE-ONLY-TEST: Skip running the test.
* THIS-TEST-SHOULD-NOT-COMPILE: If TEST.swift compiles, test fails.  
  Used to test for Swift code that STC should reject.
* THIS-TEST-SHOULD-NOT-RUN: If TEST.tcl runs in Turbine, test fails.
  Used to test for Swift logic that should crash Turbine.

== Numbering

The tests are numbered for lexical sorting by shell glob.

000::       Script fragments, noops, assert()s
100::       Basic function calls, errors

== Adding a test

Simply create tests/TEST.swift and run-tests.zsh should find it.
Optionally add setup script, check script, expected output.

== Clean

Use ./clean.sh to clean up files created by the test suite

== JUnit tests

STC also has pure Java unit/integration tests in addition to these system
tests.  These can be run by invoking +ant test+ in the code directory.

== Code Coverage

If you enable JaCoCo code coverage, a .jacoco.exec file will be generated
for each test.  You can generate a coverage report from these by running
+ant full.coverage.report+ in the stc code directory.  If you have a
non-standard layout, you may need to specify the location of the
directory with .jacoco.exec files with +-Dsystem.test.out.dir=path/to/test/output+.
