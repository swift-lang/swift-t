# TURBINE: SETUP EC2

# Creates files on all EC2 instances to run Turbine
# The Swift/T AMI should have installed all the major software:
#     this is just for minor settings

# You must set the following environment variables:
#  TURBINE_EC2_KEY: The path to the private key file

# Requires ec2-host
# See: http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/11399488246/simplifying-ec2-ssh-connections

# Assumes TURBINE_USER is root (for now)

# Creates: Remote KEY file (pem) for inter-instance SSH for MPICH
#          Remote .ssh/config file to automate SSH options
#          Remote hosts.txt file to pass to mpiexec -f
