STC HELP

OPTIONS
----------------------------------------
    -A <argname>=<value>
         Bind command-line argument at compile-time, allowing
         creation of a compiled version of code specialized
         for given setting
    -C <output file>
         Write intermediate representation to this file (otherwise
            does not output it)
    -d <PORT>
       Use JDWP debugging on given PORT
    -D <MACRO>
       Define a CPP preprocessor macro
    -E
       Just preprocess
    -h
       Show all options
    -I <DIRECTORY>
       Add an include path
       TURBINE_HOME/export is always included to get standard library
    -j </path/to/java>
       Set JVM location.  Defaults to PATH entry for java
    -l <LOG>
       Log stc progress to given LOG.
    -L <LOG>
       Log stc progress to given LOG with trace-level logging.
    -O <Optimization level>
       Set compiler optimization level:
         0 - no optimizations
         1,2,3 - standard optimizations (DEFAULT) (this will change later)
    -p
       Disable preprocessing via CPP
    -r
       Add an RPATH for a Swift/T extension
    -T <option name>
         toggle compiler option on
    -t <option name>
         toggle compiler option off
    -u
         Only compile if target is not up-to-date
    -v
         Output version and exit
    -V
         Increase verbosity.  May be given twice

COMPILER OPTION NAMES
----------------------------------------

Features:
--------
checkpointing: enable checkpointing support (on by default)
refcounting: enable garbage collection by refcounting (on by default)

Optimization passes:
-------------------
dead-code-elim: eliminate unused variables, instructions and branches
      (this must be enabled for most other passes to be useful)
flatten-nested: flatten nested blocks
value-number: value numbering analysis to eliminate common
      subexpressions, optimize array lookups, eliminate redundant
      loads and stores, etc.  value-number has several further
      extensions that can be enabled
finalized-var: extension to value-number that detects finalized
      variables and simplified instructions/statements accordingly
constant-fold: extension to value-number that propagates constants
        and does compile-time evaluation of expressions
shared-constants: extension to value-number that lifts constants
     into shared global constant region for reuse
unroll-loops: unroll loops with @unroll annotation
expand-loops: expand small loops with fixed bounds
full-unroll: aggressively unroll loops based on code size heuristic
controlflow-fusion: fuse together loops over same range, etc
expand-dataflow-ops: expand dataflow version of functions or operations
      int explicit wait, loads, local calls, and stores
wait-coalesce: rearrange task dependencies to minimise the number
               of tasks/variable subscribes
hoisting: hoist calculations out of loop bodies
reorder-insts: try reordering instructions within block in dependency order
pipeline: compile-time pipeline where sequentially dependent worker
        tasks are merged into a single task
function-inline: inline calls to functions selectively depending on
        function size and number of calls.  This allows inter-procedural
        optimization
function-signature: modify function signature e.g. pass value instead
        of future
disable-asserts: disable assert statements (off by default)

Experimental/other features:
-------------------
refcounting: reference counting-based garbage collection (experimental)
auto-declare: allow omission of explicit type declarations by using
        local type inference (experimental)
no-stack: disable the explicit distributed stack (on by default)
no-stack-vars: disable putting user variables in the distributed stack (on by default)
