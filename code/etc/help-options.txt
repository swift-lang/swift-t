COMPILER OPTION NAMES
----------------------------------------

Features:
--------
checkpointing: enable checkpointing support (on by default)
refcounting: enable garbage collection by refcounting (on by default)

Optimization passes:
-------------------
dead-code-elim: eliminate unused variables, instructions and branches
      (this must be enabled for most other passes to be useful)
flatten-nested: flatten nested blocks
value-number: value numbering analysis to eliminate common
      subexpressions, optimize array lookups, eliminate redundant
      loads and stores, etc.  value-number has several further
      extensions that can be enabled
finalized-var: extension to value-number that detects finalized
      variables and simplified instructions/statements accordingly
constant-fold: extension to value-number that propagates constants
        and does compile-time evaluation of expressions
shared-constants: extension to value-number that lifts constants
     into shared global constant region for reuse
unroll-loops: unroll loops with @unroll annotation
expand-loops: expand small loops with fixed bounds
full-unroll: aggressively unroll loops based on code size heuristic
controlflow-fusion: fuse together loops over same range, etc
dataflow-op-inline: expand dataflow version of functions or operations
      int explicit wait, loads, local calls, and stores
wait-coalesce: rearrange task dependencies to minimise the number
               of tasks/variable subscribes
hoisting: hoist calculations out of loop bodies
reorder-insts: try reordering instructions within block in dependency order
pipeline: compile-time pipeline where sequentially dependent worker
        tasks are merged into a single task
function-inline: inline calls to functions selectively depending on
        function size and number of calls.  This allows inter-procedural
        optimization
function-signature: modify function signature e.g. pass value instead
        of future
disable-asserts: disable assert statements (off by default)

Experimental/other features:
-------------------
refcounting: reference counting-based garbage collection (experimental)
auto-declare: allow omission of explicit type declarations by using
        local type inference (experimental)
no-stack: disable the explicit distributed stack (on by default)
no-stack-vars: disable putting user variables in the distributed stack (on by default)
soft-target: enable support for soft-targeting (requires support from Turbine)
